# Part 1

# Part of verbose_logging.
# It transports session and user data from the controller to the logger.
#
# Based on http://www.simpltry.com/2008/05/09/enhanced-rails-logging/
#
# This module gets included into ActionController::Base to gather
# the information we need about the user and the request. The
# Logger doesn't have all that info in scope.
module DataToThread

  # Called when this module is included into another module or class. Adds
  # the assign_data_to_thread before filter.
  def self.included(base)
    base.prepend_before_filter :assign_data_to_thread
  end

  # Adds the session_label to the Thread.
  def assign_data_to_thread
    Thread.current[:action_controller_session_id] = session_label
  end

  # This the method that composes the user:session_id label for the log line
  def session_label
    # see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1001597/accessing-the-session-key-cookie-name-from-anywhere-in-rails
    session_id = cookies[ActionController::Base.session_options[:session_key]] || "NOSESSION"
    login = logged_in? ? current_user.login : "NOLOGIN"
    "#{login}:#{session_id}"
  end
end

# Part 2

# Monkey patched by VerboseLogging to add the information coming from the
# controller at the beginning of every
# line generated by logger.* or RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER.*

# The patched method is BufferedLogger#add

# Part 3

# Monkey patched by VerboseLogging to add the extra information to the

# The patched methods are log_processing_for_request_id and
# log_processing_for_parameters.
# Code like http://www.simpltry.com/2008/05/09/enhanced-rails-logging/
# doesn't work for me.
# Furthermore this code keeps changing in about every Rails version so I better
# have a look at it.
